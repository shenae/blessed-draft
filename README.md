Implementation Problems: Making the bot, having a keyword search option for the bot to respond to/with and using the twitter API. 

Explanation to Solve the Problems:  The bot will be created by using Twit, the API client for Node. I will make a keyword array for the bot to search for and reply to with tweets.
