# General Assembly - Final Project

## Project Name: Blessed Be the Pantsuit

## Project Overview
This is my final project assignment for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. Here are the requirements: 

1. A working API, hosted somewhere on the internet
2. A handmade front-end that consumes your own API, hosted somewhere on the internet
3. A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
4. A link to your repository hosted on your personal Github account, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
5. A README.md file with:
    - Explanations of the technologies used
    - A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took
    - Installation instructions for any dependencies
    - Link to your ERDs - Diagrams of your models and their relationships.
    - Link to your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    - Link to your wireframes – sketches of views and interfaces in your application
    - Descriptions of any unsolved problems or hurdles you had to overcome
